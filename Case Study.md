### Potential problems that may arise with the dataset while building the Machine Learning algorithm
  * **device_name:** 1.	Device name could be a good predictor of the gender if we have a list of all names in the world/target countries with their corresponding genders. However, the field of device name has 60% of the values missing, which makes it difficult to fill the missing data, as it is not numeric and couldnâ€™t be filled with statistical techniques like median, mean, mode etc.
  * **app_category and ad_category:** Around 1.8% of the app_category and ad_category fields is NAN. As it is a small percentage, it can be excluded from the dataset
  * **app_category and ad_category:** These features are represented as strings, while they should be converted to categories. One hot encoding technique will enable encoding it to numbers before we can fit and evaluate a model.

### Feature engineering
  * Two techniques of feature engineering can be utilized to find the features that are likely to be the most important for our model:
    * **Lasso/Ridge regression** for feature selection
    * **Feature extraction** for dimensionality reduction and combining existing features to create a new, more useful feature
 
### Model selection
The case study represents a binary classification task, and my first model choice would be Binary Logistic Regression. 
This aproach has several benefits, amongst which is that it is fast, accurate for simple datasets as this one and well-performing. Rather than straight away starting with a complex model, logistic regression is sometimes used as a benchmark model to measure performance, as it is relatively quick and easy to implement.
Meanwhile, logistic regression is not efficient in capturing complex relationships, and in case of the advancement of the dataset, more advanced techniques like Neural Networks should be used.
